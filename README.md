Hello, I'm Paulo Maluza Braga,

I decided to learn programming right after I finished my Master's Degree in Semiotics when I realized I could expand my creativity making life easier for myself by programming.
The magical thing is that I really enjoyed coding and it reminds me of the time I started doing graphic design in 2013.

Everything is still too magical for me and I know it may become harsh once the achievments becomes pursuit for money making.
Until that times come, I'm having lots of fun.

Contact me if you want to live that with me in your team or project!
